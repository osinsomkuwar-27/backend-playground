# Backend Playground 🧪

This repository contains my **practice code** while learning backend development
with **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**.

It is **not a project repository** — it is a collection of small experiments,
examples, and practice files created while understanding backend concepts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## ❗ Important Notes
- This repository is **only for learning & practice**
- Code may be incomplete or experimental
- No production-ready structure is expected
- `.env` files and secrets are NOT pushed
